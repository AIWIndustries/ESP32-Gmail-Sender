# ESP32_Gmail_Sender
This is an adaptation of the ESP8266 Gmail sender program. It allows for ESP32 to send emails to one recipient or multiple. 

Make sure to place these files in the ....\Arduino\hardware\espressif\esp32\libraries folder. At that point it should show up as Gsender in the examples for ESP32 Board.
